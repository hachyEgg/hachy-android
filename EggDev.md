# Egg is a winner. 
- a visible network of blood vessels spreading from the center of the egg outwards.
- (bad Candle)clear bottom half of the egg (where the air sac is) and the darker top half of the egg (where the embryo is developing).
- (Good Candle)dark outline of the embryo at the center of the network of blood vessels, embryo's eyes, which are the darkest spots inside the egg.
- you might see the embryo moving!

# Quitter
- Some quit due to poorly maintained temperatures or humidity, some are contaminated by bacteria, while others simply have bad genes.
- a blood ring. A blood ring looks like a well-defined red circle, which is visible on the inside of the shell. 
- It forms when the embryo dies and the blood vessels supporting it pull away from the center and rest against the shell.[1]
- blood spots or blood streaks inside the egg, however these dark patches can be difficulty to distinguish from a healthy embryo at this early stage.

# Yolker.
- The egg looks the exact same as it did when you first candled the eggs before putting them in the incubator.
- The inside of the egg looks fairly clear, with no visible dark spots, blood vessels or blood rings.
